	description "Due to many Pilots of mining ships' complaints with the short range and general feebleness of the standard Mining Laser, a solution was made; taking the prospecting power of the Mining Laser and combining it with the higher power of the Heavy Laser, Beam engineering has developed the Heavy Mining Laser; a more powerful, albeit bulkier version of the Mining Laser meant for more heavy duty Mining Ships."
	description "	The modern Mining Laser is a derivative of the Beam Laser engineered to optimize mineral yield and extraction rates at the expense of range and shield damage."
